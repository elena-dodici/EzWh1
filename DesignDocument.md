# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements, and be consistent with the APIs

# High level design 

EzWarehouse is a single threaded layered application. It uses the MVC architectural pattern because we have a view that changes based on the data we have.
We have a 3 tier architecture since we have the View, The application logic and a database.
The choice was also made to obtain a lower cohesion and to increase mantainability.
Since the frontend (View) is given we built the backend architecure with:
- Controller: Connects with the entities to manage them and their data. Has function to connect with the database too
- Entity: Incapsulates all the domain classes of our applicationm

# Low level design

From top to bottom in the diagram we have:
- Controller layer (The classes marked as *Manager* plus the PersistencyManager)
- Model layer (The classes under the Controller layer)

Each layer can be seen in the class diagram. Each model class has an attribute called *tablename* that is used by the PersistentManager to modify the correct table in the database. A generic class to manage the database with generic methods was used to keep the connections simplier. The persistentManager uses the ***Singleton creational pattern*** because we only need one instance of the PersistentManager at the time.

The Controller classes are marked as *Manager* and they communicate with the entities to manage their data and call the persistent manager to load/store/delete/modify them to fulfill the requests that come from the frontend.

To better visualize the diagram we split it in 2 parts
