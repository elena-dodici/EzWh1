# Informal description
Medium companies and retailers need a simple application to manage the relationship with suppliers and the inventory of physical items stocked in a physical warehouse. 
The warehouse is supervised by a manager, who supervises the availability of items. When a certain item is in short supply, the manager issues an order to a supplier. In general the same item can be purchased by many suppliers. The warehouse keeps a list of possible suppliers per item. 

After some time the items ordered to a supplier are received. The items must be quality checked and stored in specific positions in the warehouse. The quality check is performed by specific roles (quality office), who apply specific tests for item (different items are tested differently). Possibly the tests are not made at all, or made randomly on some of the items received. If an item does not pass a quality test it may be rejected and sent back to the supplier. 

Storage of items in the warehouse must take into account the availability of physical space in the warehouse. Further the position of items must be traced to guide later recollection of them.

The warehouse is part of a company. Other organizational units (OU) of the company may ask for items in the warehouse. This is implemented via internal orders, received by the warehouse. Upon reception of an internal order the warehouse must collect the requested item(s), prepare them and deliver them to a pick up area. When the item is collected by the other OU the internal order is completed. 

EZWH (EaSy WareHouse) is a software application to support the management of a warehouse.

# Stories and personas
WH worker: John is 35, he has been working in a warehouse for 5 years.  His main job is carrying items (by forklift or manually ) from one place to another place according to the managerâ€™s requirements. He cannot hold his cellphone in hand while working,  he knows the exact position of each section. He prefers to see the instruction which can let him easy to understand.

OU manager: Anna is 28, she works as a manager in the OU department. Her daily work is issuing orders to the Warehouse department. She needs all information must be correct in the order and can obtain the status of the orders in real-time. 

WH manager: Daniel is 40, works as a warehouse manager. His job is receiving the order from the company, keeping track of the inventory periodically, and issuing new orders to suppliers if there is a shortage. He is a really strict person during work, but some mistakes may happen when different orders come together. Hence he needs some tools that could help him to organize all the tasks. 

App Administrator: Jonny is 25, works in an IT department in the company, he just entered as a fresher in this department and he also has to learn many technologies from the beginning.  he prefers to use the application with a simple and comprehensible instruction or interface so he could handle it quicker.
